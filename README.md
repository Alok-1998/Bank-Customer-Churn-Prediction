# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Introduction :-
Machine learning approaches have recently become a popular choice for
solving classification and regression problems. In this model, I explained how
we can create a machine learning model capable of predicting customer
churn. Customer churn prediction is crucial to the long-term financial
stability of a company.
Here I have taken a randomly sampled population of 10000 customers
from three European-based banks. This project intends to propose an
efficient predictive model for customer churn in the banking industry, using
different supervised classification techniques. Model performance, goodness
of fit, feature selection, class imbalance and dealing with outliers will be
discussed in this project.

Technologies used :-

Data Processing (EDA and Modeling) :-

● Numpy
● Pandas
● Matplotlib
● Seaborn
● Scikit learn

Graphical User Interface :-

● Joblib
● Tkinter

Overview of the steps :-

❖ Importing the libraries
❖ Loading the dataset
❖ Selecting relevant features
❖ Exploratory data analysis
❖ Converting categorical columns to numeric ones
❖ Preprocessing the data
❖ Training a machine learning algorithm
❖ Evaluating the machine learning algorithm

Conclusion:-
The ability to identify customers that aren’t happy with provided solutions
allows businesses to learn about product or pricing plan weak points,
operation issues, as well as customer preferences and expectations to
proactively reduce reasons for churn.
